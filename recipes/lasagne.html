    <h2>About the recipe</h2>

    <p>Garfield's Lasagna Recipe With Minced Meat And Italian Spices takes more 
        time to be prepared but at the end of the baking when you smell this divine 
        combination of minced meat between herbed lasagna pasta sheets, you will definitely 
        feel that it was totally worth it. The lasagne can be eaten with just some fresh salad 
        like Carrot Beet Amaranth and Vanilla Panacotta for a welcoming accompaniment with a glass of wine. 
        Since nothing is deep fried in this dish and olive oil is used, it can be relatively healthy 
        and quite filling.</p>
