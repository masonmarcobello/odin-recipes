# odin-recipes
Introduction: this basic recipe website is the first small project in the Odin course designed to reinforce the fundamental commands and workflow using HTML, Git, CSS, and GitHub.

By the time I complete it, I should have a better understanding of how to create the skeleton structure of a website and a clearer understanding of adding messages to git, committing them, and then pushing the work to GitHub. I'll update this readme.md file with my reflections on the exercise once I complete it.

As an update, after finishing this exercise, I've learned how to link video files, create footers, position elements and items with HTML and CSS, and make images as links. Admittedly I started using chat GPT for guidance to speed up the process, but I figured repetition is the father of learning. Eventually, these basic sites will come intuitively for me (along with understanding the logic and page layouts/structure).
