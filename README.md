# odin-recipes
Introduction: this basic recipe website is the first small project in the Odin course designed to reinforce the fundamental commands and workflow using HTML, Git, CSS, and GitHub.

By the time I complete it, I should have a better understanding of how to create the skeleton structure of a website and a clearer understanding of adding messages to git, committing them, and then pushing the work to GitHub. I'll update this readme.md file with my reflections on the exercise once I complete it.
